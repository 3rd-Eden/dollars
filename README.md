# Dollars

**write less, do more, save dollars** - This is _the_ utility library for
Node.js.  It contains all the bat-shit-crazy utilities that ship and create
between different projects.

## Installation

```
npm install --save dollars
```

## Usage

In all examples we assume that the library is required as followed:

```js
'use strict';

var $ = require('dollars');
```
